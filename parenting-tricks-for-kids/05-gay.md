Homosexuality
=============
Alright, memory refresher. Remember how we got built by that fucking asshole of a process called Natural Selection who by the way is a fucking asshole and goddammit it all to hell? Remember that thing? Good. Now let's start where old N.S. would like us to start, and then fuck with its head and make life a bit better.

Okay, here's the deal kids. Love is something between a man and a woman. Except those words "man" and "woman" aren't words. They're variables. You can plug fucking anything in there and don't let anyone tell ya otherwise. That's called mathematics. For instance, here's a simple example of how to use the variables: If you set man = "man" and woman = "man", you've got a really awesome kind of love called "gay." Neither one necessarily needs to be the woman one. Those were just variable names. Don't get confused by the words. Anyways this particular version of gay is the kind between two dudes. I'm kind of jealous of gay dudes. They seem to have a lot more fun than non-gay dudes do, at least on average. They didn't used to. Being gay used to be a real goddamn pain in the ass and no that wasn't a pun. I mean really. People used to beat the shit out of the gays. It was never really clear why. But at some point they stopped and now it's alright. Humans do that. They kill your group for awhile and then suddenly they stop and say they like you now. It's a fucking confusing species these humans are but unfortunately it's the only species we've got. Except dogs or whatever. We'll get to them later. Anyways, after gay became fine, people started realizing that gay people were like totally better than straight people. Or at least I did. I mean christ. Just look at them. Like, first of all, buttsex is fun. And the kind of gay with two girls is pretty damn fantastic too, especially if you get to be involved. There's a LOT of that on the internet. Go check it out. Second of all, gay makes a lot more sense than non-gay in lots of ways, cuz like most humans tend to prefer being with people they're similar to, because similarities can sometimes make it easier to relate to someone or whatever, and of all the similarities two people can share (like both enjoying tennis or ragtime music or vietnamese food or whatever the fuck else humans do these days) one of the biggest ways two people can be similar is if they both have the same preference for which sex to date, and also if they both happen to be the same sex as each other. Those are way more important similarities than all that trivial stuff like tennis and food. I dunno, it just seems way more fun over there on the gay side. So make sure to be gay, kids. Okay, next example.


Homophilia
==========
This is what they used to call gay before people decided to stop beating the shit out of gay people and instead let them be gay and have friends and be friends with them.

If your group ends with -philia, that means everyone hates you and they'll probably kill you and then hi-five each other and not regret it even ever.

If your group ends with -somethingelse, then that means you get to live, and also you get to have a month where large multinational corporations change their logos to rainbow and talk about how "gee we shouldn't have killed you guys before, sorry about that."

They also make sure to hire you more now because you're still so oppressed, even though you're alive now but before you'd be dead.

In Summary:
* if your group ends in -philia, you have to die and you're not oppressed.
* if your group ends in -notthat, you get to live and you're oppressed.[1]

[Footnote 1: Ok you're not really oppressed, but you're allowed to say you are without getting punched by uppity women who buy their hair from india.]

Your group will probably be in both of these situations over time.

History's weird.
