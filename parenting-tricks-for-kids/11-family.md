Family
======
A completely mysterious kind of relationship based on sexless incest.

These relationships are essentially life-long arranged marriages,
beginning in infancy, and always determined without your consent.

More research is needed to figure out exactly what this shit is
all about, and why everyone seems to be acting like it's okay.


"Family"
========
This is all that matters.

I mean, this is all any of us really wants in life, right? 

"Family" (not to be confused with Family, which sucks) is the only thing that really actually matters in life.

"Family" is the people you choose to spend your time with.

Day after day. Through thick and thin. In sickness and in health.
Until death do us part. Like all those 1990s sitcoms with the
tight-knit groups of friends. A place where everybody knows your name,
and they're always glad you came (no not like that (though maybe (it depends))).

Unfortunately, like most good things in life, this is illegal too.

You're not allowed to decide who you spend your time with.

Yes really.

Wait hold on I'm serious. If anyone says I'm making this up,
they're probably a lame boring person who hasn't tried very
hard at all to find a "family." (From here on, I'm just gonna
drop the quotes and call this family.)

Here's the deal.

You're a new human, about to get born.

You don't know what part of the earth you're gonna be born on yet.

Let's imagine you get born on a tiny island with like 6 people on it.
Or 6 million, whatever, same idea either way.

Now, if you're lame and boring, you're in luck, and I'm sure you'll
find some people who understand you and accept you, right nearby,
wherever you are.

However, some people are weird, actually most people are kinda weird,
and for one reason or another, they're a little bit lonely on whatever
little island they happen to have been born on.

So as the beautiful perfect weirdo which I'm sure that you are,
imagine one day you use some technology thing to search the entire
world and find exactly the kind of people who you can build a family
with. Your people. The ones you'd die for. Maybe they're all like you.
Or maybe each one is super different. But they're Your People.
Your tribe. You'd do anything to bring those people to wherever you
are.

So maybe you all make a groupchat and you talk every day, and you save
up money for plane tickets as a group along the way. Then after you've
all decided on a place to live together and a flag and a family crest
and a silly little motto, and you have enough money to pay for all the
plane tickets to finally bring your family to you or bring you over to
them and you go to the airport to finally unite with your tribe and
sorry motherfucker this is actually illegal.

Why's it illegal?

What on earth did we do wrong?

The answer comes from our old friend, the government.

See the government doesn't let you just "invite your friends over"
to "stay with you." Even if you've got a nice stable job and a big
enough place.

There's a large bureaucracy in place, in nearly every country,
to keep you from being with your chosen family. They're the
part of the government involved in something called immigration.


We
==
In summary, my child, in the world we've prepared for you.

It's illegal to find your people and buy a home to bring them to.

Unless they happen to have been born on the same island as you.

as H.L. Mencken said,

throats."

Our topic is morality.

This book is by our family.

We think you deserve a family too.

Raising the black flag is the only moral thing left for us to do.
