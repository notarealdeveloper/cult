Bestiality
==========
Okay, bear with me. (No not that kind of bear. (Not that kind either. (Fuck this, lemme start over.)))

(*ahem*)

Sometimes a person wants to fuck a person who isn't a person. I mean, the first person is. But not the second one. We'll call the first person "a person" and the second person an "aperson," which means "not a person." We can call them other words too, but the "a" at the beginning reminds us they're *not* a person, so whatever word we decide to call the second person, just make sure it starts with an "a" to remind us. Also, if you want a helpful abbreviation, you can drop the last 4 letters and just abbreviate the word "aperson" to "ape." Abbreviations are fun. Okay here's the deal.

In the real actual world, it's apparently not unheard of in hospitals and stuff for an old lonely girl like a grandma to be admitted to a hospital emergency room with something stuck in her, for some value of "something" equal to basically, well, a dog. 

Here's how grandma got to that point.

See, men die real early. At least on average, compared to grandmas. And everyone gets lonely, even if there's lots of other people around. And hell if there's zero other people around, we definitely get lonely. And also, humans still get all grossed out about the idea of relationships with sky-fire-ring-number gaps bigger than like basically zero, or 50, or whatever, numbers are dumb. So, here's life: You're born. Then you get distracted, and suddenly you're old. Then us men start dropping like flies. And because of that, a lot of grandmas end up alone. Like a fucking LOT of them. Not joking here. You just don't see them, but they're out there. And those grandmas, they've been around for awhile. They're like you, but smarter and more wily and better. But when you're old and you're lonely and all the men are fucking dead and sky-fire-ring-gap-things aren't okay either, sometimes a creative grandma says "Y'know what fuck you people I'm gonna try something new," and then the emergency room gets a visitor.

That's because dogs have a thing where for some reason it, I mean, like their pants parts, but the dog versions (if dogs had like... dog pants) part of it turns into like a tennis ball and it's really fucking hard to get them out of things once their dick is inside it, so sometimes they get stuck in there.

And yes this is a real actual thing. It isn't evil or bad. It's just one of the many things that loneliness and time do to people. That's how life goes. Okay now here's the real deal.

Grandma deserves to do whatever the fuck she wants to, kids. Don't you dare tell grandma what to do. Respect your elders. Except for me. You definitely don't have to respect me. I just... like... I don't know how to deal with it. It makes me all uncomfortable. Respect is fucked up. But respect grandma. No matter what weird shit she likes. Grandma is good. Grandma is way fucking better than you.

Or as the founding members said in the earliest writings of Our People:

> Feel disgusted? Take some drugs. The medicine kind.
> Grandma takes drugs. And Grandma's just fine.
> If you ever find yourself feeling a bit nauseous,
> maybe the sick one is like, y'know, you.
> 
> -L.D.â„¢, The Basic "We"-based Unified Theory of "Ew":
>  A Treatise on the Treatment of the Trait known as Bitching.

Wait hold on, I'm still not done talking about grandma. Grandma was always so nice to you. I mean jesus, she literally made you a sweater like every fucking year for Christmas. By hand. And you know she's got arthritis. Alright, now having thus discussed the topics of grandma and holidays, that brings us to the next relatively-related topics.


Incest
======
The best way to make thanksgiving more interesting.

Incest is the exact opposite of bestiality.

Bestiality is when the person you fuck is too different from you, genetically.

Incest is when the person you fuck is too similar to you, genetically.

People really care about both of these directions.

Your gene-things have to be exactly just similar enough but not too much,
or else people get really violent and angry and then arrest you.

You have to aim for the exact arithmetic mean of "too different"
and "too similar."

If you guess right, congratulations! You get to live.

This is why arithmetic is important, not just geometry.

Now technically, you can't do the arithmetic on paper.

When you meet someone, you can't see each other's genes,
so this one is pretty tricky to get right in practice.

Here's one trick you can use to solve the problem.

Try to imagine the exact mathematical average between
"a dog" and "your mom", and try to fuck that.

Just make sure never to go too far in either direction,
because both directions are extremely illegal.

Ok, now that we've covered incest, we can finally explain family.
