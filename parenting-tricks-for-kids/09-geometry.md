Polyamory
=========
Sometimes a person loves a person except the second person is really N people,
for some N > 1. This often happens when a person gets so tired of losing their
only real friend every time a breakup happens that after like N (that's a
different N) years of the same goddamn pattern they say "fuck it" and try this,
and life gets different.

Not that different though. These relationships are basically just like the
normal ones except you get an incredible amount of practice at communication
and you also get yelled at a lot more.

Also you'll notice that after you start trying this, suddenly all the friends of 
everyone you ever love decide they fucking hate you and assume you're the guy with
the two red triangles on his head. Until they meet you. And then they're like
"oh nevermind you're cool, let's hang out," and you're like "I can't hang out
I'm busy and my life is falling apart and I'm tired all the time but whatever
at least I finally have friends."

So that's polyamory, kids. It's a real goddamn pain in the ass sometimes.
But give it a shot. You might notice that you feel like yourself for the
first time in n years. Or N years. Or however old you are whatever who
fucking cares.


Polygamy
========
Polyamory for grown-ups.

This is when you do polyamory (which is 100% legal) but instead of being a
whiny blue-haired baby about it, instead you decide to be a responsible
adult and make sure the people you love have equal legal protections
and also make sure you can't just leave them randomly one night without
doing a lot of paperwork or giving them a bunch of money, which is good,
because it incentivizes you to stick with them and work through conflict,
which is a responsible thing to do in relationships that are meant to last
forever, especially when there's kids involved (that's you).

Ok, now this part is confusing, so sit down.

These relationships are totally legal, as long as you're a whiny baby about it.

These relationships are suddenly illegal if you try to be responsible.

That responsible thing is called marriage.

Some people think marriage is good. Some people don't. But basically everyone agrees that it's responsible.

So, if you're this kind of person, make sure not to be responsible, or else you'll get very very arrested.

So if this is your thing, then make sure to be an irresponsible little bitch and definitely don't date anyone in those disgusting other countries ew that's not allowed so no overseas partners ever except the first one because if you have the audacity to fall in love with a dirty foreigner for N > 1 then you'll be in a fucking complicated situation kid my god lemme tell ya, there's community colleges and acceptance letters and visa interviews and rejection letters and "I didn't go to my visa interview cuz I was sad" and then you drink too much and your first wife gets mad, but not about everything, just about the drinking. If you try to do this shit kid, make sure you have a superhuman ability to pretend you're ok.

Anyways, you probably won't need to worry about that. Because in N > 1 relationships,
being responsible is just plain illegal.

It's illegal to be responsible in these relationships because of something called the government.

The government is basically a big terrorist pig with a gun and an erection covered in blood and no attention to detail except the details that nobody gives a goddamn fuck about.

The government exists because of something called society.

Society is basically a bunch of little well-meaning pigs with sticks and limp dicks and no attention span for things that matter like genocide but oh my god do they pay attention when a baby in Iowa falls down a well.

That's society.

Society invented the government, to steal things from themselves because they don't think roads are possible without it.

Society is pretty ok sometimes, it's just a little retarded.

But the government is the #1 worst thing there is.

It's really not clear why we allow it to exist.

Someone should really start cutting off heads at some point.

I would, but I don't believe in violence and also eew cutting off heads sounds really really gross.

But still, I mean damn.

This one is rough.

It sucks that love for N > 1 is legal if and only if it's not responsible.

I've lost a fucking lot of money trying to work around this one.

Or, uh, not me...

I mean someone somewhere probably has.

Don't worry about it.

I'm not crying, you're crying.


Geometry
========
## (Or: Advanced Poly(g?)am(or)?y)

Some people imagine that poly(gamy|amory) is all about the sex,
or that it's one big giant orgy party all the time. It's not really
either.

Here's the deal.

Even when it's allowed, orgies almost usually never happen.
But surprisingly that's mostly because that sort of thing is
just structurally a fucking pain to coordinate. Cuz I mean like,
even if you don't care much about planning and you're down for
being spontaneous and stuff, every person in a situation like
that has their own independent emotion-y state, and people's
emotion states change over time, from day to day, and even
during the day. And when your emotion state varies, you start
getting more or less okay with the idea of doing certain stuff.
Like eating a cake, or going to an orgy. And when you don't want
to do something, you sometimes might get less okay with the idea
of your partner(s?) doing that stuff too. Even if you have a
relatively freedom-y relationship model where basically anything
is technically allowed technically, you still care about [person],
and when someone you love is feeling sad you should probably cancel
any awkward dumbass orgy plans you might have if you have them,
so you can take [person] out and get them that cake they wanted
and maybe watch TV and cuddle or whatever. That's just common sense.

Now, multiply that situation by the number of people in whatever
"orgy" you're imagining. See how improbable it is to coordinate
all that shit? Exactly. That's why those things don't happen much,
even if they're totally allowed.

Now not all geometry is about sex. Orgies may be mostly nonexistent
and definitely overrated, but orgies are a sex thing, and there's way
more in life than just sex things. There's also relationships.

One common geometry situation is what some people call a throuple,
which I think is a really unfortunate term because come on guys the
word "threelationship" is obviously a way better and funner word to say.
So those are a thing sometimes. And actually they're not all that
different from twolationships. Except with twolationships, the geometry
is always just a line, whereas with threelationships there are two
possible geometries: a V, or a triangle. In a V, sometimes everyone's
okay hanging out together occasionally, or sometimes one or some people
don't want to. Either way is okay though. However, in a triangle,
it's basically always allowed for everyone to hang out together at
least occasionally, because like, well, everyone is dating.

However, just because everyone is dating doesn't mean everyone has
to spend time together always. Definitely not. I mean fucking christ
that would get quite tedious and exhausting. In fact, sometimes
it's better for everyone in a triangle if each of the edges exists
as a separate individually strong two-people-y thing, and then
whenever all three of you hang out, everyone is already really
close just as edges, and then there's less likelihood of anyone
feeling left out. Geometry is important.

Now, if you're going to be in a relationship with someone where the
total number of relationships added-up between both of you isn't just
two (i.e., you dating them and them dating you) then just remember:
These relationships definitely have lessmore problems than other relationships.

They have less problems because people don't usually feel quite as pressured
to be every possible imaginable thing that their partner might want them to be,
which is nice.

And they have more problems because time and energy are things, and
also because jealousy is a thing, and despite what the academics in
raincoats might tell you (or whatever that shit is, it might be like
a rope sweater I don't know), jealousy isn't just some kind of modern
social construct. It's a universal human feeling type thing. That's
okay though. Lots of things can be biological without being inevitable.
Like the plague. Or ebola. Ebola isn't learned. It's super biology-y.
But it's also not something you're definitely gonna get. But ebola's
a bad analogy. A better analogy for jealousy would be like a cold or
the flu, because jealousy is way more common but way less bad than
ebola. Also, if you get it, it doesn't mean you have some kind of
personal defect. It just means you went near something that causes
the thing. What thing? The jeaflulousycold thing. And just like the
flucold, there's no one answer about whether it's better to avoid it
altogether or just forge ahead and take a risk of getting it. Or rather,
there *is* a right answer, but the right answer isn't just a word,
it's a function. And it's a function that depends on whatever you and
your relationship person decide between yourselves about how to handle
the whole situation together, and the function doesn't depend on anything
else. It's just f(you). But the plural version of "you." Like f(you two).
It just depends on the two of you together. Just make sure to communicate
about it well. Good communication is really important.
