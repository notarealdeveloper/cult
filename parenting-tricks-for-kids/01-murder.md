Murder
======
Sometimes one person will do something on purpose
that makes another person not be a person anymore.

They don't turn into something else. They just stop being alive.
Some people think they probably go somewhere else, usually up,
cuz that's the hardest direction to check, and we already checked
all the other directions. Except down. Some people think dead
people go down sometimes too. Other people think dead people
probably don't go anywhere. They just stop being a thing.
But either way, they definitely stop being part of our lives.

Adults call this lots of words.

They call it "murder." Or "killing." Or "homicide."

Don't worry about remembering all the words. Just know it's
really mean. Why? Well, it's mean because it usually causes pain,
and more importantly because it un-causes lots of things that we love.
We love the idea of our future life plans. But with murder,
one person has to change ALL their future plans and instead
be dead forever instead of doing the plans, and all just because
some other person had "kill this person" as ONE of their plans.
That's pretty fucking unfair.

Murder is one of the worst things people do.
There aren't many things in life that are "definitely bad,"
but murder is *definitely* definitely bad. Except when it isn't.

There's one time when it's not bad.
The only reason it's ever okay to murder someone is if they
start by trying to murder you (or someone else), and you try to
stop them without murder but for some reason you can only stop
them from murdering by murdering them. Then it's pretty okay.
I mean what else could you do in that kind of situation? Not much.
If you think of something, tell me. It would be nice not to have
to murder those people either, but it's the best idea we've
come up with so far.

It's also sort of fair:
Murderers can get murdered, but no one else deserves to.

Now, you're allowed to think that other people deserve to be murdered too.
You're also allowed to think that no one ever deserves to be murdered.

You can re-decide all of this stuff for yourself.
You don't need to agree with me on anything.
But the stuff I say here should help you get started.

Okay, that's enough murder.

Now time for some rape.
