## Satan
Small beard. Two red triangles on the head.
This fucker's not real. They're gaslighting you. Next.

## Santa
Take the above. Add more beard. Subtract one red triangle.
(Don't worry, it's just a hat this time.)


## God
Take the above. Add more beard. Subtract one red triangle.
(Now that's a fucking pattern kids, damn!)


## Natural Selection
Okay, this one deserves some time...

The process that built us is called Natural Selection.
And it's a fucking asshole. That's right. The person that built us
is the worst person that has ever existed, and it's not even a person.
It's not even alive. It's just a fucking dick.

It's heteronormative. Cisnormative. Sexist. Homicidal. Genocidal.
Infanticidal. (But probably not racist, fortunately) Xenophobic.
But also nice things like family-friendly and sometimes cooperative.

But don't worry. That's not all as bad as it sounds.

For example, it's not sexist in the sense that either sex is better. 
Just that it made the sexes definitely different.
Natural selection doesn't give a fuck. 
It doesn't care if we're happy.
It just has a big psychopathic hard-on for making copies. 
It loves when things make copies.
Anything.
Any piece of matter.
Especially if the copy-making matter occasionally fucks up
and keeps making copies but different.
Natural selection loves that.
It's a totalitarian pageant judge in a totally bizarre contest
between a bunch of fucked up copy-machines.

That contest is called life.
The copy machines are us.
It built us so we could do that, because it loves that.
Okay, now here's the secret...
Fuck natural selection.
Natural selection is a dick.
It's a lazy deadbeat absentee god, and y'know what?
It can't even hear us right now!
It's not here. I mean, it is. It's everywhere.
But it can't hear us. We don't have to do what it wants.
We're all orphans. We can do whatever the hell WE want.

So fuck natural selection. Fuck it now and forever.
However, that said, it was very nice of it to build us,
and one of the fun things it gave us is called sex.
