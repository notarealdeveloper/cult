Sex
===
We probably should have gotten around to this before the part about rape,
but whatever. It feels better here. Not really sure why. And when it comes
to sex, it's always best to wait until you're sure you feel ready.
So the section goes here. Therefore any editors who might want to
move this part can suck it... (suck what?... i dunno, the section.)

Okay, here's the deal.

See that area in your pants? What do you mean you're not wearing pants.
Oh right, you haven't been born yet. Almost forgot. This is one of those
"Here's what life on earth will be like when you get here" type situations.
Anyways, if you've been able to follow the discussion thus far, you presumably
understand the concept of pants. You do? Okay good. Now check down where your
pants would be if you had some. I'll turn around so you can have some privacy
or whatever. Okay. See those parts? Those are called sex parts. They're used
for lots of things other than sex, and sex can use parts that weren't built
for sex too. That's part of the whole "natural selection built us but fuck
it, who cares, it can't tell us what to do" thing (see the section on gods
for details). But whatever. For now, let's just talk about the pants parts.

Now, there's a large set of verbs that humans and other animals do with those parts.

With a few exceptions, those verbs are called sex.

The sex verbs are almost usually fun.

If they're not fun: stop doing them and go do something else.

Your time is valuable. Don't be wasting it on stuff you're not enjoying.

Okay, so let's get down to business and define sex.

(Narrator: the author pauses here for a long period, probably several weeks.)

Ok uh... I may have underestimated the difficulty of this problem.

As we'll see in the sections below, it's pretty fucking hard to define sex.

And anyone who says:
    "yeah whatever I can do it"
      ("do it" = "define sex," not "sex" itself
        (though to be fair "do it" is also slang for sex
          (dammit stop this)
        )
      ) okay so here's the problem.

The words "sex" and "love" are sort of the same
type of words as "stuff" and "thing."

They can mean almost anything, but not really anything.

But that doesn't mean they're vague or meaningless.

They're just abstract.

And general.

Kind of like mathematics.

You kids understand mathematics right?

Of course ya do.

(Narrator: note to the attentive reader, this part of the bible (or
rather, the sequel to the bible (which you're currently reading)
but I digress) comes after "The Book of Numbers", also known as
Burn Math Class, which is why we're assuming you kids already
understand math. Every bible needs a Book of Numbers. It should
always be one of the first five books of the bible, and it should
always come 4th. But the 4th one comes first, in the order of when
you write them. You always start at number 4, just like Star Wars.
Don't worry about that for now. For now, back to sex.)

Okay so "sex" and "love" are kinda like "stuff" and "thing".

They're abstract and general, but not meaningless.

Just like mathematics.

Here's what I mean.

Let's just say sex is anything you do with your pants parts.
Not all things you do with the pants parts are sex,
but they can be,
at least for someone somewhere.

Similarly, love is any time you really like something.
Not all things you like are love,
but they can be,
at least for someone somewhere.

That'll make way more sense in like 1 minute when we get to the examples.

For now, here's the most important thing to know:

Every kind of love has a corresponding kind of sex,
though sometimes there are really totally regular types of love
for which the corresponding type of sex isn't regular at all
and sometimes those kinds of sex make humans really fucking angry and violent
if you do them even ever. We'll get to some of those soon.

For now, just know that the kinds they get angry and violent about change from time to time.
They also change from country to country (at any given time),
and from person to person (within any given country (at any given time)).

Adults like to make simple things really fucking complicated.
They don't do it on purpose.
They don't actually *like* complicated things.
It's all mostly just a way to avoid having to deal with their feelings.
Especially with feelings they're kinda afraid of feeling.
And that actually makes all the convoluted shit they do sort of cute.
Adults are cute.
So for now just know that sex can be basically anything you decide to do with your pants parts,
except peeing and a few others (it's a bit of a continuum honestly),
and that some kinds of sex are okay,
while other kinds will make people want to kill you immediately,
and "which is which" changes a lot so you'll never be quite sure about anything
and you always have to keep checking,
but the adults don't like to talk about it all openly
so you can't usually check without looking it up on the internet
which they usually don't want you to do either for some of the types of sex.

Becoming an adult involves forgetting how weird all this shit is
and slowly starting to think it's the only way of being alive.

Make sense?

No?

Okay good, here we go.
