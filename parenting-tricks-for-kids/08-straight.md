Bisexuality
===========
When you're gay and straight.
Wait we forgot to do straight.
Sorry about that.


Heterosexuality
===============
We value pedagogy skills here at L.D.â„¢, so let's give each of
the members a shot at answering this one. I'm sure we'll get
at least something interesting out of it.

Alright.

Dear members, explain the depraved paraphilia known as
"heterosexuality" to a new human who's just getting ready
to be born.

Okay, they did.

Here's what they said:

Heterosexuality. (noun).
------------------------

1. When two humans who aren't the same gender get really really good at watching television together.

2. The simplest non-trivial example of human bestiality.

3. When a man and a woman fall in love and then the former fucks the latter in the ass.

4. When you look into the abyss and the abyss looks back into you except the guy-half of the abyss keeps its socks on during sex.

5. The thing Tiny Tim was.

6. When a penis and a vagina meet and then fuck each other in the humans.

7. An environmentally harmful mental condition in which a person displays a persistent sexual and/or romantic obsession with individuals who are nowhere near the same sex as themselves.

8. When you put a plastic bag in a woman and an erection in the bag and fuck the bag while imagining that you're fucking the woman so you can ejaculate in the bag which is inside the woman so the woman doesn't steal your genome and combine it with hers into a Frankenstein clone thing and then incubate it until it grows just large enough to be able to do exactly nothing at all except eat all your income, though to be clear the latter kind of income isn't to be confused with the former, however tempting the pun may be.

9. What?

10. The Microsoft Windows of sex: it's fucking everywhere, it's the factory default, it's mostly focused on legacy support, your grandma probably uses it but not very well, there's something called a "registry" that somehow gets filled up with a bunch of goddamn unnecessary bullshit, it comes with large superfluous components you're not allowed to uninstall, you're supposed to worry more about viruses than you do but fuck it whatever most of them are asymptomatic anyway, and it's definitely probably the right system for you if you just wanna do something simple that everyone else is doing too, though as soon as you want to do something clever or new or anything-the-designers-didn't-intend-you-to-do, you're gonna have to move to some completely different type of system that like almost no one uses except weirdos and nerds or else you're gonna start noticing how fucking poorly designed the whole system actually is underneath. But don't worry about any of that, it's probably all you'll ever need.
