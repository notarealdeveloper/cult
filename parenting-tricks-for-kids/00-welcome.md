Hi there.

Welcome to earth.

It's fucked up here but also really beautiful and fun.

Before you get born and start doing this life thing,
we first need to explain a bit about what it's like here.
We'll start by covering some basic morality and shit,
so you know what's generally okay and what's not.

Then, we'll give you some tips about how to have fun while you're here,
by covering some topics that people are really uncomfortable with.
Those are usually the fun ones.

Okay, first the morality.
