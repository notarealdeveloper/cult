Rape
====

Sometimes a person will have sex with someone
who doesn't want to have sex with them back.

It's one of the most emotionally painful things a person can do.

There are probably worse things out there,
like if you're a parent and then your child dies,
but [being-forced-to-have-sex-with-someone-when-you-don't-want-to]
is definitely near the top of the list of bad experiences.

1. The more you don't want to, the worse it is for them to do.
2. And the harder they make you, the worse it is too.
People forget that part sometimes, but it's true.

Now, admittedly, this whole idea might seem weird at first,
because there are lots of situations in life when you have to
do something you don't want to do. Like going to work, or
washing the dishes. Most people don't like doing either of
those things ever, *and* they have to do them anyway.
But most people *do* like sex, so at first you might think
that rape would be *less* bad than having to do the dishes
or going to work.

It turns out that's REALLY not true.
Not even close.
Our brains are weird.

We can talk later about why it makes sense for rape to be so
psychologically painful, and why therefore no one should ever
do it to anyone ever, but that's a different topic.

For now, just know that rape is always bad.

Now, remember with murder how it was okay to do it in the rare
case where someone tries to murder you first?

Well for rape, that's allowed too, but it wouldn't really
accomplish much. It wouldn't accomplish anything actually.
That's what adults call "counterproductive." That's because,
unlike murder, sex is symmetric. Like, if person A is having
sex with person B, then that means person B is also having
sex with person A (though they could definitely be enjoying
it different amounts, or not at all). Because of that, if
you try to do the thing where someone tries to rape you and
instead you rape them back to stop them from raping you,
that doesn't work. It doesn't even "sort of" work.
So let's just agree that rape is always bad.
No exceptions.

The only exception is if someone you know has a fantasy
where they want you to pretend that you're raping them,
but secretly you both know you're just having regular
consensual sex on purpose.

The keywords in that sentence are (1) "consensual" and (2) "pretend."

It's always okay to pretend anything.
And consent is what makes it okay to do non-pretend things.

That said, if you ever think someone is asking you to do pretend
rape to them, just make really really sure you didn't mis-hear.

Ask them again like 10 or 20 times until the fact that you keep
asking them starts to get funny, just to make sure it's what they
really actually want, because if what they actually said was, like,
I dunno, "grape," that could lead to a really awkward fucking situation.

So just make sure to be sure.
Then go for it. Have at 'em. Take turns. Be weird. Have fun. Life's short.

But also remember to make sure that *you* really want to do the pretend thing too.

If either one of you doesn't want to do it: don't do it.

That's a good rule to live by for pretty much everything.

Linguistic Side Note: If you've ever heard a bit about the
history of words -- something adults call "etymology" -- you
might know that the mini-words "pro" and "con" usually describe
something positive and negative (respectively). Or being "in
favor of" or "against" something (respectively (again)). And
you may also know that "sensual" is a fancy adult way of saying:

> I want to say "sexual" (or something like that) but I'd prefer
> to say a word that makes me sound more sophisticated and fancy,
> because secretly I'm kind of embarrassed about sex, even though
> if I'm saying the word "sensual" I'm probably pretending really
> hard that I'm not, and most likely I'm currently holding a wine glass.

Adults like to sound fancy. And they fucking love wine.

So anyways, "con" basically means "not" or "against" or "in opposition to,"
while the word "sensual" means "sexual," plus connotations of fluffy
adult bullshit and wine.

So, when you first hear that the word "consensual" is used to describe
sex that both people are doing on purpose, you might think whoever started
using the word that way must have been some kind of rape afficionado.
Like someone who really really really likes rape. Because only a rape
afficionado would describe *all* voluntary sex by using a word that
basically means "opposite of" + "sexual".

Words are weird. But not as weird as people.
People are probably the weirdest things there are.

However, all hope is not lost, because "con" also has another meaning.

What's that?

Well, a "con" can also be like when you persuade someone to
do a thing or believe a thing by using lies and other stuff
you just made-up to trick them. However, that's still sort of
fucked now that I think of it, because then "consensual" sex
would be sex that's really just lying about the fact that it's
"sexual," and the only sexual sex would be sex that's not
"consensual." So okay, there's no way around it, whoever made
that word must have been really into rape. That's okay though.
Bad people sometimes make really good things, and the concept
of consent is a really good thing. So forgive the word for
seeming like it means "hooray rape" on the surface, because
in reality, it actually means exactly the opposite.

Let's summarize what we've learned:

1. Rape's always bad, so never ever ever do it unless they're asking for it.
2. But like LITERALLY asking for it. No metaphorical bullshit allowed here.
3. Save the multiple interpretations for literature and stuff.

Okay, that's all for rape.

Now let's quickly cover a few more topics before we get around to the fun.
