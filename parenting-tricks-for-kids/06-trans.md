Transsexualism
==============

Sometimes a man is really deep inside a woman or vice-versa.

Wait no that's normal sex (

   okay fuck this, lemme start over.

Sometimes a man is really a woman deep inside or vice-versa.

(Okay that's better. (Permutations are tricky.))

So, if you meet someone like this, you'll notice that they're (a) regular, and (b) they seem to have some kind of grammatical-telekinetic superpower where they can make people nearby start stuttering during the parts of sentences where the pronouns are, because people don't want to fuck up and be lame and get yelled at but jesus it's tricky sometimes even if you're totally okay with everything.

Trans people are cool though.

At least the cool ones are.

Every group of humans has cool ones and not cool ones.

I dated a trans [pronoun-redacted-cuz-whatever] one time for like 3 years and [aforementioned-human] was awesome. Also s/he was way smarter than basically everyone. Like oh my god. Also one of my favorite things about h\*(er+im) was that s/he *actually made up her own mind about stuff.* That's rare for humans. And believe me, her decision to say "fuck this shit, I'm a he" at a point in life after we dated was *definitely* not the only thing s/he made up her mind about. That was relatively small beans for this bean. She (now he (but don't fuck with my story)) would do all sorts of things that people don't normally do. She was a year older than me (and still is (because time)), and when we met she'd been dating a guy for like 2 or 3 years, who she'd started dating when she was 19 and he was 52. And at first when I heard that I was like "avast, those are in fact different numbers," (paraphrasing here (just go with it (it's easier this way))) but then they broke up because she and I met on the internet and then s/he moved from her country to my country and we lived in the same apartment for awhile. Eventually we applied to grad schools together, but then unfortunately we got into all different grad schools, so s/he went to one place and I went off to the country where she came from. Same university actually. That country in something called "Canada." So I'm newly in grad school at this point (the first grad-school time) and suddenly living in her old home town, Canada. And in an interesting turn of events, I got to meet the dude! The 52 year old I mean (or whatever, 52 plus or minus 2 (numbers are dumb)). And oh-my-holy-fuck that guy was fantastic. He actually ended up being my landlord. And even better, we ended up being really good friends. I have exactly zero negative stories about that guy. Except that I miss him. That's negative, I guess. There was this one time when his Boss Man at The Job Thing He Did was like being really sexually aggressive toward him without 52's permission and he (52) ended up losing his job, and I tried to help out a bit by writing a letter thing to the job people explaining how 52's-fucking-awesome-and-goddammit-you-give-him-that-job-back-right-now because he's really good at it and this situation's rather fucked up eh? Anyways, that's the story of how I dated a brilliant person with pronoun powers for some years who had also had a really fantastic but completely-socially-unacceptable age-gap relationship thing. And conveniently enough, that brings us to...
