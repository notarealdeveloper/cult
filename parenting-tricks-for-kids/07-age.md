Pedophilia
==========

Okay, people get all bent out of shape about this one,
but it's actually pretty simple, so sit down and listen closely.

Once you get to earth, you probably won't want to fuck any old people.
Because (a) why would you, and (b) most old people are gross. Especially me.

So, the majority of what normally gets lumped into this one is actually
covered by the thing about rape. If you don't want to fuck someone: don't.
If they do it anyway: we set them on fire. Simple. Inexpensive. End of story.

However, the tricky situation arises if, for any reason, before you've
been here on earth for N rings around the great fire in the sky
you ever find yourself actually *wanting* to fuck an old person.

You probably won't ever want to, for the reasons above,
but if you ever find yourself wanting to: DON'T DO IT!

The reason why you shouldn't is something we don't often talk about.

It's not for you. It's actually for your parents.

They love you, and they're the reason why there are such severe
laws about all this.

Parents can be tricky to understand, so here are some...

## Parenting Tricks, for Kids!

Ok, here's the deal. You see, your parents are good people,
and the thought of you having sex with someone before they want
you to makes them really sad. Like REALLY sad. So sad that they
put people in a box for the rest of their lives for doing it.
Even if you ask them not to. And then other people in the box
usually kill the person they put in the box. Don't worry, they
don't make you go in the box. Just the other person. But look,
your parents love you so much, probably more than anyone else
in the world, so even the faintest possibility that some kind of
large-N-sky-fire-ring-number person might be tricking you into
consensually having sex or drinking drugs or not believing in
their gods or anything they don't like makes them really really
scared. Adults get scared. It's why they put people in the murder
boxes. And it's why you probably shouldn't have sex with anyone
until your parents are ready for you to. Before that, just agree
when they say you're not capable of consenting to stuff. And yes
I know that's kind of like weird rapist logic they're using on
you there, but they're only doing it to protect you. Parents will
burn cities to protect their kids. It's actually really sweet of
them. Being a parent is fucking hard probably. Be glad you have
people like that in your lives. When you're older you won't
always have people like that. They'll die eventually. Not yet.
But soon.

So while they're still around, appreciate them and treat them
well, but don't forget to keep their wits sharp by messing with
them a little. Studies show that the best way to slow the onset
of Alzheimer's is by keeping an active mind. So keep their minds
active. Just agree with your parents when they tell you that you
don't have the mental capacity to consent to stuff yet, and then
use that logic against them when they try to make you mow the
lawn or whatever. Just say you can't consent to that, so them
making you do it is rape. Child rape. And say child rape really
loud. So the neighbors can hear. Adults appreciate volume. Their
hearing isn't what it used to be. You can keep having fun with
this trick for literally 18 motherfucking years. How great is that?
See how scared they look? Adults are cute. It's fun finding all
the little things adults are scared of. You can even use that
fear to bribe a bigger allowance out of them. Or a new phone.
Or maybe even a car if you're good at it. You can also invent
words that sound like the words they call people they don't like,
and then call them those words. When I was like eight I remember
inventing the word "ageist," like racist but for age, and calling
my mom that when she said I was too young to do something. She
didn't even know how the fuck to respond. She just stood there.
It was hilarious! Keep their minds active. They sure aren't
keeping them very active by themselves. Even better, you can
make up new words by combining words they're scared of with
words that describe whatever they're asking you to do. Like
homework rape. Or racist sweatshop child labor. Adults can
handle getting a taste of their own medicine. That's what makes
them adults. And if they can't handle it, just tell them that
they're acting like children and you don't think they can
consent to stuff anymore. Then wait until you hear sex noises
coming from their bedroom and call the police, and say that
both of your parents are fucking someone who
"appears to be a child, as far as I can tell." They won't
appreciate the humor now, but in like 10 or 15 fire rings
they'll probably agree that it was a really funny story.
Just don't do it more than once. All things in moderation.

But remember, with most of the things they do, they're really
just trying their best to help you. So keep them on their toes,
but don't go too hard on them. Your parents are good people.
Probably better people than you are.
That'll make more sense when you're older.
