## Church && School

Hello, world. Welcome to Cult. It's super fucking badass in here.
In this repo, we will keep track of the things we learn together.
Along the way, we'll see that the education system of the outside
world totally sucks balls, and it's way more fun and efficient to
learn things from church. Not regular people's church. Just ours.
Our church has git repos and config files and shit. Praise Santa.


## Getting Started

Here are some commands you might want to run early on.

1. Store your git credentials.
```
git config --global credential.helper store
```
This should save your git password so you don't have to type
it every time you push and pull from the cult repo. If you're
super duper paranoid, don't do this. But for most normal humans
this is totally ok.

2. Rebase on git pull
```
git config --global pull.rebase true

``` 
This will make git behave in a more convenient way when you
run `git pull`, if you and someone else have both made changes.
we'll cover what's going on here in the future, when we talk
more about git. For now, just imagine this is the default.


## Todo

While we're learning The Meta Discipline (and making the Children
of this great family into highly employable badasses), it's very
important to make sure we become incomprehensible to the outside
world. Remember, every cult needs bizarre private jargon no one
else understands. So while we're writing documentation and code
and adding new words to our cult language, make sure to do so in
a way that will make the outside world think we're fucking insane.
By mixing semantic writing (aka ancient emojis (aka hanzi)) and
phonetic writing (like, alphabets and shit) we can convey things
to each other while intentionally misleading the outside world.
For example:

> Fi一st 事ings 一t, 二 事ings 二

To Our People, this clearly says

> First things first, Second things second.

While to the English speaking world it appears to say
something like:

> Fisting stings.

That's great. Let's do more things like that.

Sincerely,
